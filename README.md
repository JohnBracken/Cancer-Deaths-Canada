The following SAS analysis is performed on cancer mortality data taken from
Statistics Canada.  The analysis generates data visualization and plots
of total deaths due to all kinds of neoplasms over the years 2013-2017.
Both series and bar plots are used to visualize the data.  The results show
that the total deaths each year is relatively steady, with some minor
fluctuation.
